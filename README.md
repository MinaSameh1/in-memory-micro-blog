# Microservices Simple Blog App

This is a simple full stack micro services app that I used to learn about microservices, sharing data etc.

Currently all dbs of the services are in memory structures, I wanted to focus more on the stucture instead of having to worry about DBs connections etc. 

I also created a simple Event Bus from scratch to learn more about it.
